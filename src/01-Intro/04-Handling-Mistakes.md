# Mistakes

In the case where the text of the Documents includes a clear typo or similar error, the line should be interpreted as intended, not written. While this could be abused, an errant accidental "not" should not yield a full accountability process and investigation when no harm is actually done. Just because a document says "Bigotry is allowed" instead of "isn't" doesn't mean in that context we suddenly allow Bigotry sometimes. Please point out such mistakes so we can fix them.

## Technical Mistakes

All Documents may outline specific technical implementation details - such as role permissions, specific bots, or channel structures. In the case where a Document is ratified with a mistaken understanding of the scope of permissions a role needs to fit its description, or a tool's functionality is misunderstood (such as a bot's features being more limited than expected, or requiring a premium subscription), the next-best solution should be implemented so long as it doesn't violate the spirit of the guarantees it's trying to uphold.

As an example: if a bot is used to collect feedback via a form, and the form text is to be redirected to a dedicated forum post in the leadership area - creating a new channel or redirecting it to an existing leadership channel is okay, but redirecting it to a public channel is not. Care should be taken to make the new solution as close as possible to the proposed one (so redirecting to a very active channel may cause something to get buried, as compared to a dedicated or low-traffic one).

If found, significantly better technical solutions may be adopted to replace the outlined solution by a simple majority of the Tier 2 body responsible for managing the policy (typically the POND Planners or Developers). 

All such changes may be done without requiring an approved update to the Documents, but they should eventually be updated under the [Refactoring](./02-Changing.md#refactoring) rules for simple documentation purposes. The one exception is if the new tool falls under the [User Bot Policy](../Policy.md#user-created-bots), in which case stricter review standards apply.
