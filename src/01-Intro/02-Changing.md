# Changing These Documents

To add, remove, or alter a governing document, a 2/3 supermajority of the POND Planners is required. Any removed document is considered entirely repealed and must be done with extreme care. Individual documents shall define their own alteration rules within the Document itself.

Any change to any of these documents, including [Refactors](#refactoring), should be announced to users.

## Refactoring

Documents may be "refactored" with a majority vote of any tier 2 leadership team - as long as text is not substantively changed, the exact wording or organization of these Documents may be altered to correct typos, improve poorly-worded statements, or make them easier to navigate. This includes splitting Documents, combining them, or changing which Document a section is in. Before the vote, refactors must be put up for review by leaders (and optionally the wider userbase or volunteer non-leader users) for at least 2 days. Just for a few pairs of eyes to point out any editing errors or unintentional substantive changes.
