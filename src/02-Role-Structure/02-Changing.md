# Rules for Changing The Role Structure

The [Non-Leadership Roles](./04-Non-Leadership-Roles/01-Non-Leadership-Roles.md) section may be changed at any time by a simple majority of the [Planners](./07-Leadership-Roles/03-Tier-2/06-Planner/01-Planner.md), this document need not be updated to track every little such role change, but it is encouraged to periodically update it just to maintain a useful reference document. Major changes to the leadership **structure** and **duties** must follow the general be ratified by a 2/3, 48-hour [Automatic Abstention Vote](../03-Policy/04-Voting/02-Auto-Abstain.md) of the entire POND leadership (Tier 2 **and** Tier 1) after a mandatory 2-day review period by Community Members.

There are some exceptions to this 2/3 margin, the following changes may be made with different processes: 
  1. Altering the maximum or minimum number of seats
    - This may be altered by a simple majority of the body increasing or decreasing their seat count
    - The maximum cannot be lowered below the current number of seat holders
    - The maximum cannot be lowered if there is an open application to the position (including a held application, see: the [Seat Count Guidelines](./07-Leadership-Roles/03-Tier-2/02-Seats.md) and [Misconduct Handling Procedure for Leadership Applications](./05-Leadership-Requirements/03-Applications/03-Serious-Accusations.md))
      - People with held applications may be asked if they wish to voluntarily withdraw it
     - If there's a reasonable suspicion that a body is decreasing their seat count simply because they suspect a certain user may soon apply and wish to prevent it, an accountability procedure may be initiated
  2. Changing the frequency of leadership meetings
    - This can be altered by 3/4 (rounded up) of all affected Tier 2 leaders, and the Secretaries. This is set at a higher threshold to ensure that the meeting attendance frequency is not increased in a way that "soft-fires" other members of the group (intentionally or accidentally).
  3. Minor changes to leadership role names and "flavor text" (i.e. how we summarize their purpose/niche)
     - This is essentially the same as making changes to to Non-Leadership roles, it's so minor there's no purpose in a big spectacle. This document should be updated at some point to reflect it for accuracy and usefulness, but it's not urgent

In addition, the Documents-wide [Mistakes](../01-Intro/04-Handling-Mistakes.md) and [Technical Mistakes](../01-Intro/04-Handling-Mistakes.md#technical-mistakes) exceptions apply.
