# Discord Powers

All leaders at minimum have access to the following: pins, timeouts, role management (only used for Ticket Mute unless Tier 2), message deletion, and bans. Minor/specific permissions may change as defined in the [Role Alteration guidelines](../02-Changing.md). However, unless one is a [Moderator](../07-Leadership-Roles/02-Tier-1/04-Mod.md) one should not use moderation powers (barring a *very* good reason, such as timing out a user late at night when no mods are online).

As all Tier 1 positions are opt-in by a simple at-will reaction role change, it doesn't make sense to limit these permissions to the sub-roles (it will make the roles tab messy and channel specific permissions too hard to manage - and a hypothetical CL working in bad faith could get the powers with a simple reaction anyway). That said, a leader abusing roles such as improperly using mod features, will force at least a temporary leadership role removal, and a requirement to go through a formal accountability process.

If abuse of this system becomes a recurring pattern, restricting access to the permissions and attached roles may be considered, but unless and until that proves necessary, users are encouraged to keep in mind that any leader will technically have access to these permissions when reviewing leadership applications. 

All leaders also will have access to all tickets. They are bound by the Policies regarding ticket information security, but more importantly - compared to the old system, this reveals significantly less sensitive information (as sensitive matters are handled off-server).
