Resignations on Good Terms are defined as resignations due to life circumstances such as stress, moving away from the area, or simply lack of interest or capacity. Which is to say, making a decision to resign for the good of oneself or the community, with no hard feelings.

For Tier 2 leaders in particular, leaders who are retiring on good terms are humbly requested to participate in a knowledge transfer and torch-passing with the remaining leaders and/or new leaders who take their place. They should be open to occasional requests to clarify old procedures, or decisions. These are not requirements, especially for resignations due to circumstances like ill health, but retiring leaders should be aware of the expectation.

Leaders who submit a good-terms resignation will be barred from reapplying to their position for 3 months - this is to prevent putting undue strain on the application process, and discourage role chaos. There is a grace period of a week to change your mind, where you may be reinstated without an application no questions asked, unless someone was already approved to take your place as a Tier 2. This privilege to change your mind is only afforded once per year.

Leaders who resign on good terms will, barring an explicit request to the contrary, be given a kind farewell and "thank you" announcement, with an optional personal statement from them to the userbase about their departure.
