# Resources for Leaders

This is a list of all resources leadership should have access to:

- POND Staging - a server where we test out bots and new ideas without affecting the wider server.
- [Onboarding Resources](../05-Leadership-Requirements/07-Onboarding.md)
- [POND Portland Github](https://github.com/POND-Portland) - All Leaders should have membership to this - all Planners should have owner privileges. (If desired)
- **MEDIATORS ONLY** - A list of Conflicts of Interest as per **TODO**
