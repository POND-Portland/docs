# Going On-Break

Any leader of either tier may go "on-break" at any time - for any (reasonable) duration. This will remove the user's leadership roles, grant them the honorary "Leader (On-Break)" role, and revoke access to leadership chat and tools. Leaving the server will be considered "on-break" unless a formal resignation is submitted.

As of now, Leaders may go "on-break" as often as necessary, and for any reason.

That said, within two weeks of the adoption of this document, we commit to deciding on formal guidelines for:
- A threshold of "excessive breaks" (both in length and frequency)
- What happens if the number of members in a Tier 2 body dips below its minimum size due to the break 
- "Abuses" of the concept of a break (such as a Tier 2 conveniently taking a break every month to dodge a meeting) 
- As Mediators on break pose special challenges, potential special procedures if a Mediator goes on break (especially if all existing Mediators have a conflict of interest in a situation) 

All of these situations will need guidelines put in place and the work will be done on this during the internal policy reform immediately post-restructure, with this document updated to reflect that.

For any votes, the On-Break member will be considered as abstaining.

NOTE: Due to stupid technical details with our ticket system, leaders have to *manually* leave Every. Single. Ticket. to lose access. On Break leaders are not expected to do this (but obviously cannot participate in them). We hopefully will adopt a new ticket system without this problem relatively soon, but it's lower priority than many other tasks. That said if On-Break leaders *want* to leave tickets for a more relaxing vacation, they are heavily encouraged to do so.

NOTE: Due to Discord limitations, the [Server Owner](../07-Leadership-Roles/04-Miscellaneous/02-Owner.md) has a few caveats when going On-Break, explained in their role section.
