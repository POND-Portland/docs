# Tier 2 Roles

Tier 2 roles are higher intensity roles than the Tier 1 roles. In particular, every Tier 2 role has at minimum a requirement to respond to leadership-related pings, give feedback, and submit votes within 24-hours unless On Break. In exchange, they are given voting power on resolutions within their specific body. As outlined in [Leadership Meetings](../../05-Leadership-Requirements/04-Meeting-Attendance.md), they also are required to set the agenda and attend regular leadership meetings.

People may be and are encouraged to be multiple Tier 2 roles, but a separate application is required for each. In fact, the [POND Planner](./06-Planner/01-Planner.md) group is required to have at least one [Mediator](./04-Mediator/01-Mediator.md) and at least one [POND Developer](./05-Developer/01-Developer.md) on it, to make sure that new proposals and resolutions for the server direction don't make the other bodies' jobs harder, or stretch their capacity too thin.

All Tier 2 roles also have the duties of their matching Tier 1 roles.

## Technical Permissions

All Tier 2 roles have the Discord "Administrator" permission, meaning they can in principle perform any action shy of server deletion or managing other admin roles, as well as see all threads and channels. While most info in leadership chat is non-privileged (especially since mediation is moving to a DM-based process), this shouldn't be a huge deal, but they are expected to be more diligent about sensitive information in accordance with their training, and the leadership rules and guidelines.
