# Seat count guidelines

All Tier 2 roles have a designated minimum and maximum number of seats (outlined in their specific sections). If a role has fewer members than the minimum seat requirement, the application delay is suspended - allowing CLs to apply to it even if they've only been a CL for under 3 months - this allows a user who wants to step up to immediately apply to both positions to inhabit the role, though this requires fairly intensive onboarding and training timelines.

Tier 1s may apply to a body which is at its maximum number of members, and an honest discussion must be openly had about whether any of the current members should retire - for instance because life is getting too intense, they're starting to lag in their duties, and so on. While of course any leader can resign at any time, historically, people have been reluctant to resign because they're worried their work won't get picked up - this allows the conversation to happen at a time when they can be sure their duties won't go unfulfilled. If nobody feels it's time to resign, the application (should it be successful), will be stored, and the applicant will be given "right of first refusal" should a position open up in the future (processed in the order of accepted applications).
