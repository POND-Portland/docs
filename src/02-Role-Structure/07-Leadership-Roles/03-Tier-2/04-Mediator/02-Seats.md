# Seat Count

**__Minimum Seats:__** 3
**__Maximum Seats:__** 4

The mediator count is low because high-stakes conflicts don't come up that regularly, so in many cases they won't have much to do aside from plan and undergo training; submit reports, feedback, and proposals to the Planners; and organizing meetings. 98% of the time, these will be interchangeable with regular server moderators.

There are special rules for situations where no Mediators are eligible to mediate a conflict outlined in the relevant section on [Mediator contingencies](./Policy.md#contingencies-when-no-viable-mediator-is-available).
