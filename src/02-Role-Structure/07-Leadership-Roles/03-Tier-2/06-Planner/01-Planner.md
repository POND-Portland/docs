POND Planners are our backend Amateur Professional Volunteer Opinion Haversâ„¢. They're meant to take a long-view of the community, and steer its direction. Planners should have a finger on the pulse of where the community wants to go and propose and workshop ideas to make it a reality. 

Planners should be comfortable with the community's culture and workings, and be able to separate useful from unactionable feedback, as well as identify and disregard feedback that goes against the character of the community. Importantly - Planners should be able to drill down into even "bad" feedback and extract the core idea and problem at its heart, and be willing to solve that even if they don't address the exact feedback as requested.

While the POND Developers are the "doers", the Planners do have some concrete duties besides proposal, debate, and voting. In particular, Planners should be active in tasks such as "drafting language" - rules, guides, resources, descriptions, etc. In addition, Planners are likely to be the ones executing some of the simpler tasks for the ideas they pass - such as creating new roles or Discord channels. However, any large enough task, even ones such as this, *may* be sent over to Community Developers so they can be responsible for breaking up and delegating the work.

Planners are not only allowed, but encouraged to inhabit other leadership roles, including other Tier 2 roles. Planners should have a pretty good idea of what's going on with the community, and be actively involved with it beyond an abstract, theoretical level. Having such responsibilities mitigates the predisposition to pass subpar measures due to losing touch with the more "practical workings" of our group.
