# Seat Count

**__Minimum Seats:__** 3
**__Maximum Seats:__** 6

The seat count is set pretty high due to a need for a variety of perspectives, but the max count is set much lower than Developers due to a "too many cooks" element. Too many people in a planning role can cause gridlock due to everyone having to give feedback, and trying to accommodate said feedback. While formal processes such as voting deadlines are in place to mitigate such gridlock, preventing the team from growing beyond a certain size is very helpful extra step in mitigating this.

In addition to the simple minimum and maximum seat requirement, there is a requirement that at any time at least one Planner must also be a [Mediator](#mediator), and one must be a [Developer](#pond-developer) - if a single Planner is both a Dev and a Mediator, they cannot fulfill both requirements at once, at least one other Mediator or Developer must be a Planner as well.
