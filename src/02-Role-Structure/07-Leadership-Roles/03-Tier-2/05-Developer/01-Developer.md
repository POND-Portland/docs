The POND Developers are the project managers and doers of the server. They are expected to have at least one long-term project they're managing - whether that be working towards a long-term goal or recurring traditions and events. The bounds of this are limitless, and could be anything from doing the legwork to scout out physical third spaces, to managing a monthly gathering of some form. 

POND Developers are empowered and encouraged to delegate pieces of large tasks to COs, and even interested non-leadership users. For example, they can post in a public "work board" or thread that they need a CO or user to call around and pick a location in a certain area for the monthly gathering.

POND Developers are unlikely to "vote" within their group very often, but some larger projects may need votes on how best to allocate resources and labor, or how to prioritize tasks and plans that they need to execute.

They should also give feedback to the Planners about whether they have the capacity to enact newly proposed plans before they pass, as well as give feedback on what kinds of longer-term projects they may want to do. Note that not all long-term projects necessarily need to be proposed - Devs (as COs, as regular users) may of course manage their own recurring events and such. It's only in the cases of establishing "official" server traditions or very specific projects such as commissioning new art, distributing official fliers, or planning for some theoretical pie-in-the-sky idea like incorporating as a Non-Profit or securing a physical location for our community that they need to explicitly get approval and more in-depth plans approved and drafted by the Planners.

Developers are also the first line in empowering regular users to make their own events. Any user that has a question on how to make events should take it to the Devs, and the Devs should mentor them. Devs should draft guidelines that show users how to make events, and what kinds of events succeed. They should be proactive in moving theoretical plans to concrete plans, and on the lookout for people that are getting discouraged due to events falling through and help users solve those problems.
