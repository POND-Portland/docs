# Seat Count

**__Minimum Seats:__** 4
**__Maximum Seats:__** 10

The number of seats for Developers is both broad, and has a fairly high max, because each Developer is at their heart just a person who wants to nurture the community and do things to make it the best it can be. The community needs as many Devs as we have big things to be executed and managed. This number is the most likely to be tweaked upwards if there ends up being a ton of interest in the position, and applicants have a very strong proposal for the kinds of projects they want to do.
