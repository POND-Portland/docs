# Community Leader

This role is an "umbrella role". As such, the vast, vast majority of its privileges are defined in the sections above ([Tier 1 Roles](#tier-1-roles) and [General Leadership Notes](#general-leadership-notes)). 

Its main purpose is to ease the application and role management process, as the Tier 1 roles are all low-stakes and low-pressure enough to opt-in.

The bar for leadership is set low enough that the vast majority of users can become CLs with no issue, and there is no membership cap. Becoming a CL is nothing more than opting in to the backend information firehose, and a commitment to contribute to the community. The entire community can be CLs if they want as long as they regularly perform their opt-in duties.
