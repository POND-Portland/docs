# Tier 1 Roles

These roles are "Tier 1" roles - which have less responsibility and are less "intense" positions. When someone [applies](../../05-Leadership-Requirements/03-Applications/01-Application.md), they apply to the [Community Leader](./03-CL.md) (CL) position, which is an "umbrella role". As such the terms "Tier 1" and "Community Leader" are roughly interchangeable. CLs may opt-in or opt-out of the three sub-roles ([Community Organizer](./05-CO.md) (COs), [Community Representative](./06-CR.md) (CRs), or [Moderator](./04-Mod.md) (Mods)) at will - though excessive switching is discouraged. 

All Tier 1s may see *all* currently active leadership channels, regardless of roles - this allows them to give input on some isolated proposal they really care about without having to temporarily declare themselves a CR, for instance.

In the event a CL is found to not be active in executing their chosen roles ("nonfeasance"), they'll be asked to stop labelling themselves with the sub-role until they have the capacity to do so. There are no ramifications for this, since the roles are merely a declaration of how one wants to use their leadership position to improve the server. CLs must have at least one specific Tier 1 or 2 role at any time, or they'll be at minimum considered as "On Break".

All Tier 1s also have a specific power not available to Tier 2s: at any time they can vote to force any Tier 2 leader to undergo an accountability process, including removing them as leader temporarily or permanently.
