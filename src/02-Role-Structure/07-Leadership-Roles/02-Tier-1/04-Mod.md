# Moderator

The Moderator ("Mod") role is extremely different from what the role used to be. While previously Mod was a mix of this and every [Tier 2 role](#tier-2-roles), it now simply deals with the day-to-day moderation of the Discord chat. This includes things such as sweeping topics into their appropriate places, banning basic spammers, setting the tone, and reminding users to tone down conversations that are getting too heated. Moderators do **not** handle major interpersonal conflict resolution (i.e. things more serious than breaking up minor squabbles in chat) - that is the job of the [Mediator](#mediator) role, which can be considered the more intense version of this role, with more stringent requirements.

Moderators are also encouraged to report back to the leadership team (especially Mediators) with concerns and observations about users who are regularly skirting the rules (in spirit or letter) or values of the server. They (along with Mediators) are encouraged to give input on or proposals for new or modified rules and policies to the [POND Planners](#pond-planner) and [CRs](#community-representative) when they identify repeated rule or cultural issues that may require new structures to mitigate.
