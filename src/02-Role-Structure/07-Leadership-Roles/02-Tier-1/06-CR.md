# Community Representative

Community Representatives ("Community Reps", "Reps", or simply "CRs") are meant to give feedback and propose improvements for the general direction of the community. This is essentially an advisory role, mixed with a bit of a responsibility for helping execute more "backend" tasks. CRs will be regularly presented with proposals for the direction of the server and asked to give feedback, flesh out language, etc. At any time, CRs may also propose their own measures, and if approved by a majority of CRs, the Planners are required to at least consider and vote on it.

This could include things such as fleshing out the rules and purpose of a new channel or section, or even giving feedback on proposals for new long-term goals, recurring server traditions, "branding" decisions (e.g. server art contests), and so on. They are considered the less intense version of the [POND Planner](../03-Tier-2/06-Planner/01-Planner.md) position.
