# Community Organizer

Community Organizer ("Organizers" or "COs") are the worker bees of the server, and very focused in particular on the event planning aspect of the server. While COs (just like regular users) may have their own projects and recurring events, their primary job as a leader is to pick up any tasks delegated to them by the [Community Developers](#community-developer) (which is the more intense version of this role). They are also expected to mentor regular users on how to make successful events, as well as help them plug their events and make them happen (e.g. if people are stuck on scheduling, COs should step in the help people decide on a concrete time and date).
