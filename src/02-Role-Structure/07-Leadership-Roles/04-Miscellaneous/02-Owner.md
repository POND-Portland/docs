# Server Owner

Due to how Discord works, we must have a server owner. It's against the Discord TOS to share an account for this purpose, so a specific person must be appointed, unfortunately. Since roles that have Administrator permissions can only be added or removed by the owner, the owner is solely responsible for executing role changes for Tier 2 members - including promotions, demotions (temporary or permanent), resignations, and the "On Break" status.

Due to the nature of Server Ownership, the owner must be a Tier 2 leader, in the event the owner leaves all Tier 2 roles for any reason, they will have to transfer ownership. Server Owners may still go "On Break", but because of the features of ownership, they will not lose access to leadership areas - but are nonetheless expected to not participate until their break is over.

In the event the Server Owner is the subject in an accountability or mediation process, they must immediately transfer ownership (except when the entire leadership team is indicted at once as per the [User Petitions](#user-checks-against-leaders)).
