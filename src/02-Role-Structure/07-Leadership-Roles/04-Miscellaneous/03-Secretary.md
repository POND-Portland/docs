We will have exactly three Secretary positions. These are pseudo-Tier 2 roles but don't fit neatly in that structure. There's one secretary at any given time assigned to each Tier 2 role. As such, they do need to submit an application for the position indicating which team they're working with. 

Secretaries are expected to attend all meetings for the body they're part of, and regularly generate reports both to give updates to different arms of the leadership, but also keep the general userbase informed with meeting minutes, summaries of recent decisions and initiatives, and similar announcements. Due to the note-taking, Secretaries do not have voting power, and are expected to minimize their contribution to discussion (because it's very hard to take notes while talking and thinking about what you want to say).

A Secretary may, occasionally, ask another Tier 2 leader on their team if they can trade duties for one meeting, in which case they will be treated as a normal member of the body for the duration of said meeting, while the person taking over their duties is treated as Secretary (i.e. the Secretary gains voting power and full discussion privileges, and the assignee loses them). Secretaries should use this sparingly.

In the rare event the Secretary is On Break for a meeting, another team's Secretary will be asked to fill in, and failing that, another leader will be asked to step up for that meeting. In the event nobody voluntarily steps up Tier 2 members in that group will select a Secretary among themselves randomly.

While a Secretary may be a *regular* member of another Tier 2 position, they may not be *Secretary* of more than one Tier 2 body at a time.

As Secretaries are a key component of our transparency initiatives and communication with users, they have fairly strict activity requirements, and a failure to meet their duties will result in their replacement very swiftly.
