# Very Boring Backend Channel Role Permissions

The currently in-use leadership channels are visible to all leaders, regardless of tier. They may also post in all such channels as needed. Tier 1 leaders are expected to not vote in the voting log (unfortunately Discord only allows restriction on adding new reactions - not stacking existing ones). While the user notes channel is available to all leaders for minor and obvious tracking of concerns about various users, Mediators are heavily recommended to keep particularly sensitive user information in an off-server location provided it complies with our information security policy in **TODO**.

Care must be taken by Tier 2 roles to remember that old archived admin area have posts that happened pre-restructure and are under different, more strict information security rules.

The more detailed plan for the creation and organization of backend channels to accommodate this structure is described in more detail in **TODO**, as well as general guidelines for when and how information may be retrieved from the archived channels.
