# Very Boring Backend Channel Role Permissions

<div class="warning">
This section is incomplete! 

It is TODO and will be fleshed out after the more urgent items.

In addition, as they are technical details they may be changed at any time (so long as they're substantively similar) - this is just documentation.

The currently in-use leadership channels are visible to all leaders, regardless of tier. They may also post in all such channels as needed. Tier 1 leaders are expected to not vote in the voting log (unfortunately Discord only allows restriction on adding new reactions - not stacking existing ones). While the user notes channel is available to all leaders for minor and obvious tracking of concerns about various users, Mediators are heavily recommended to keep particularly sensitive user information in an off-server location provided it complies with our [Infosec Policy](../03-Policy/13-Infosec/01-Infosec.md).

Care must be taken by Tier 2 roles to remember that old archived admin area have posts that happened pre-restructure and are under different, more strict information security rules.
