All leaders must undergo trauma-informed conflict resolution training, including identification of and security around sharing sensitive information. We commit to establishing specific training procedures within two weeks of this Document's adoption, in which case it will be updated to reflect the results. Since external, non-leadership users are heavily involved in designing our training, this timeline may be slightly stretched to accommodate their capacity upon request, but it may not extend past a month.

[Mediators](../07-Leadership-Roles/03-Tier-2/04-Mediator/01-Mediator.md) must undergo extra training, which is elaborated on in their own section.
