# Leadership Meetings

Every Tier 2 branch will hold a monthly Leadership meeting - this meeting should be on a consistent recurring schedule (e.g. "3 PM on the first Saturday of the month"). All Tier 2s, are expected to attend every meeting (almost - vacations and emergencies happen, we're not monsters). Leaders are generally expected to attend in person, but remote attendance is allowed if necessary. Meeting times and locations should be selected so it's easy for all required attendees to physically travel to the location.

Tier 1s are encouraged to attend meetings matching their opt-in roles, but are not required attendees and do not have voting power at said meetings - as such scheduling and location selection is not required to accommodate them.

Every 3 months, all Tier 2 leaders will have a joint meeting to sync up and make sure everybody is on the same page. All Tier 2s are required, and Tier 1s remain optional. This may or may not end up replacing the other leadership meetings that month (TBD - we'll play it by ear to see if the meeting cadence is too demanding).

Leaders may, of course, elect to have extra meetings or working sessions as they see fit.

[Secretaries](../07-Leadership-Roles/04-Miscellaneous/03-Secretary.md) are also required to attend the meetings for the bodies they're assigned to, see the role description for more details.
