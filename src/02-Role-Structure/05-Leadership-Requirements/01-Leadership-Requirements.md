Leaders must be users with the Support Area Access role (or equivalent). In addition, leaders must *not* be "Inbound" or "Not Local", they must at minimum regularly visit the Portland area. Tier 2 leadership has an additional restriction of having *consistent/reliable* physical access to Portland (to attend meetings). 

In addition, any prospective leader must have attended at least 5 in-person events, and met several members of the team(s) they're applying to.

If any of these requirements are not met, their application will be voided (this is distinct from rejection - it does not incur the [6-month restriction on resubmitting applications](#reapplicaton-timelines), they may reapply as soon as they meet the minimum requirements).

Finally, the ability to inhabit a leadership position may be suspended or revoked at the discretion of the Mediators during or as the result of a formal accountability process.
