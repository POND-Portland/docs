# Serious Accusations of Misconduct for Applicants

<div class="warning">
This section is incomplete! 

It is TODO and will be fleshed out after the more urgent items.

In the event of an anonymous accusation of misconduct, we will announce that we received a very serious complaint (without details). However, due to the principle of "Do you really think someone would do that? Just go and tell lies on the internet?" The system is too easy to abuse anonymously. As such, we will give the accuser(s) a couple of days to file a formal complaint with a mediator - in which case an investigation and conflict resolution process will be launched. The leader's application will be treated as "on hold" until the investigation is concluded. 

In the case where the accusation appears to be substantiated, and a positive resolution cannot be reached, the application will be rejected even if they otherwise passed the objection threshold. 

In the case where the accusation appears to be spurious, or a positive resolution to the conflict is reached, the application will be treated as normal.

If the accuser does not come forward, the objection will be counted as a normal objection. Should the complaint be genuine, the user may always come forward at a later date when they feel more comfortable to launch an investigation process, and the regular mediation process for members of the leadership team will be used.

> ℹ️ - We do not have a clear definition for "serious complaint", but for the first rounds of applicants it will be treated as anything to the level of abuse, bigotry, assault, harassment, stalking, etc. I.E. egregious violations of rules 1 and 2, or clear and egregious community safety violations. The team commits to adopting a formal policy for this within two weeks of the adoption of this document.
