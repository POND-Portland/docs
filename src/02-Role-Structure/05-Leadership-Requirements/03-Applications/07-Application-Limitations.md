# Acknowledged Process Limitations

We have no ability to prevent conflicts of interest, mere personality clashes, and undue bias from submitting valid-seeming anonymous objections to leadership apps. The best we can do is set the bar for approval at a level where a few complainants acting under such circumstances won't drastically sway the outcome.

People may be able to figure out who someone is from context or writing style, unless the out themselves of their own volition, they are not to be outed or investigated under the anonymous submission policy outlined in [the Policy Documentation](../../../03-Policy/13-Infosec/02-Anonymity.md).
