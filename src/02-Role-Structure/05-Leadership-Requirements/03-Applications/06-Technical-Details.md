# Fiddly technical details about how we collect anonymous objections

<div class="warning">
This section is incomplete! 

It is TODO and will be fleshed out after the more urgent items.

In addition, as they are technical details they may be changed at any time (so long as they're substantively similar) - this is just documentation.

Anonymous objections are collected via Dyno form. They will be automatically sent to the leadership area, and will be shared by a leader when non-sensitive. If marked as sensitive, the complaint will be immediately escalated to a [Mediator](#mediator) assigned to handle the conflict. In cases where a user is still uncomfortable with this, they may DM a Mediator at their discretion, and the Mediator will be obligated to start the investigation process and keep the complainant anonymous even from the rest of the leadership team.

> ℹ️ - Note that Dyno requires you to log in with your Discord account. **This does not allow us to tell who you are**. The information we get is only the text of the submission and we have absolutely no way of retrieving who sent it, Dyno just requires authentication for all forms. This is stored only on Dyno's end to make sure you have the correct role to vote, are a member of the server, and prevents you from spamming anonymous objections (to prevent one person from submitting 200 objections for one person under the guise of being multiple users).
