# Leadership Re-Application Requirement Immediately Post-Transition

The old-structure CLs and Moderators will inhabit their chosen roles upon adoption of the first version of this document as "interim" members of their chosen bodies, and must immediately (re)apply to their positions. This will be treated as one **massive** application block sharing a single objection form. This is probably going to be a bit obnoxious, but is the only way to handle this large of a task expediently, but also without giving ourselves a free pass to avoid the same community approval process every future leader must go through.

Just make it clear who you're objecting to - and for which role(s) - in your submission. Ideally on a different line for each one so it's easier to read and aggregate.

In case you accidentally submit your form and realize you forgot an objection, DM an interim leader you trust and they'll sort it out for you.

In the case like every current member is rejected we panic, we have zero way to plan for this eventuality. It probably won't happen.
