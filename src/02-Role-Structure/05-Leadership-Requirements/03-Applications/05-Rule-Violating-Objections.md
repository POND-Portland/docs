# Rejection of Rules-Violating Objections

If an application receives an objection that violates our rules - especially our rules about bigotry, it will be rejected. We intentionally do not have a clear line for what counts as "bigotry" for this nor Rule 1 in general because by its nature it can be hard to define, and any clear line drawn can be maliciously used to just barely not violate it (particularly when dog-whistles are involved).

We acknowledge that care must be taken in the grey area between ableism and legitimate concerns about mental health and how it relates to the leadership position - a more concrete process for differentiating these cases will be drafted after the initial restructure.
