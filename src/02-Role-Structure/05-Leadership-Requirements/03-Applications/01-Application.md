# Application

All roles will have public applications. In an attempt to reduce a feeling of "cliquiness", and reduce the bar for attaining leadership positions, the application process is as follows: applications will be directly posted in a #server-talk thread designated for the process - the application is a simple free-form post about what you're applying to and why. Objections will be solicited with an anonymous feedback form. If 0.8% of the current total number of Discord members object to the application within 2 days, the application will be rejected.

Anonymous objections will be handled internally, in case a [sensitive accusation](./03-Serious-Accusations.md) is made. The form will have a checkbox indicating if the objection should be considered "sensitive" or not (if Dyno doesn't allow this - instruct users to write a line specifying it's sensitive). That said, discretion may be used to keep the text of an objection in confidence if it appears that someone may have simply forgetten to check the box and it contains identifying details. Non-sensitive objections will be reposted to the application thread. All objections must be anonymously submitted through the form (to prevent a user from submitting both a public and anonymous objection simultaneously - this may change if we find a better process or bot).

## Application Staggering

Applicants must wait until the previous application is processed. This is because the objection form will prevent users from submitting multiple anonymous objections within the application window (and it's prohibitive to make a new form for each applicant). If multiple people want to apply at the same time, they're welcome to submit their applications as a single "block" and the same objection form will collect objections for all simultaneous applicants (just specify which applicants you're objecting to in your submission). 

A tier 1 leader applying to multiple tier 2 positions is also encouraged to submit all relevant applications at once, to prevent gumming up the pipeline, in which case objectors may elect to object to the application in general, or only specific roles.

The name of the Application thread should be changed to contain \[IN PROGRESS\] or \[OPEN\] depending on whether an application is currently in review, or free for submission (until a good workaround is found for multiple simultaneous applications).
