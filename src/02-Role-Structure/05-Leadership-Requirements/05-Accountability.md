# Accountability and Misconduct

<div class="warning">
This Section Is Incomplete! 

It is TODO and will be fleshed out within 2 weeks of the adoption of this Document!
</div>

For more preliminary rules on accountability and misconduct processes, as well as conflict resolution processes, please see [the Policy Doc](./Policy.md) - to be fleshed out immediately post-restructure.

However, serious accusations of misconduct will result in temporary suspension from the all leadership positions until the conflict resolution process yields a positive resolution. Some other egregious internal rule violations (again, to be worked out post-restructure), even absent interpersonal conflicts requiring mediation, may undergo a similar process.
