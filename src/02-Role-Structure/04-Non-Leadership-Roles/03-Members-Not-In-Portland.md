# What Does "Local" Mean?

<div class="warning">
This section is incomplete! 

It is TODO and will be fleshed out after the more urgent items.
</div>

We have no strict definition for "Local" but defining this is a priority after other urgent restructuring items are tackled. In the meantime our fuzzy definition is a that Regular Visitors must visit around twice a year, and an Inbound user must be making active maneuvers to arrive within about a year. Regardless, we ask all users not currently in Portland to respect our space and refrain from talking about their local communities too much, and to specify when their photos etc. are not from Portland or the surrounding area. In particular, it's bad form to compare Portland with your local community too much.

## Users Who Have Moved Away

We currently do not kick or restrict active, valued community members who have extensively participated in the in-person community that move away, but we ask them to respect our space as a local one. More in-depth guidelines for users who are **no-longer** local will be fleshed out alongside the Inbound and Regular Visitor roles. We make the same request as we do with all non-local members re: posting about their new community too much. There is currently no specific role for this, but one may be made in the future. We ask that users who have moved away to change to Inbound or Regular Visitor in the meantime.

## Not Local

The "Not Local" role is a honeypot. The server is by definition a local server, so the "Not Local" option during onboarding is meant to trap people who join and have no intention of being a part of the local community. In some cases they may misinterpret the role and end up changing to Inbound or Regular Visitor, but Not Local users may be kicked at any time. If they have been active they may get a kind talking to and a request to voluntarily leave first.
