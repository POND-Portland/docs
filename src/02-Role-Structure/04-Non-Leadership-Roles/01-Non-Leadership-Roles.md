# Non-Leadership Roles

The **New Participant** role is granted upon joining the server automatically, and after enough participation (currently defined as reaching Maki Level 4), will be automatically promoted to **Community Member**. **Community Members** gain access to the ability to opt-in to the "Support Area Access" role, giving them access to the support channels. Should the user be in violation of the support rules or it is found necessary by a formal conflict resolution process, they may, at the judgement of the [Mediators](#mediator), be stripped of support access and given a role that prevents access to the section.

Users may also be granted the **Ticket Mute** role in cases where their access to the server at large needs to be restricted, this allows them to talk in tickets but not interact with the rest of the server (including reading posts). Both [Mods](#moderator) and [Mediators](#mediator) may use this role and pull the user into a ticket.

Other miscellaneous roles may be added or removed as necessary (e.g. pronoun roles, event roles managed by a bot, etc).

**Talks Too Much** is manually granted to users when they've reached Maki Level 50, and is a joke role.
