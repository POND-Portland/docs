# Appendix

Below are miscellaneous definitions and clarifications for some terminology commonly used in the Documents:

- Community Members - when this role is referenced (e.g. for mandatory review periods), technically speaking it almost always means "Support Area Access", as that's our real gate. In the very rare event a Community Member has their support access limited, they do not qualify as Community Members for such purposes. "All users with the Support Area Access role" is just a much clunkier and confusing phrase compared to "Community Members".
- "Community at-large" - interchangeable with "Community Members".
- community members - when lowercase, this usually just means "all users".
- Ticket - A channel generated for a specific user to communicate with all server leaders.
- Backend - Leadership channels and discussions, as well as esoteric server and community management details not generally relevant to the wider userbase.
- Server - The Discord Server that the Community is hosted on.
- (Community) Values - Inclusivity, accountability, and friendliness.
