# External User Checks Against Leaders

It is TODO and will be fleshed out after the more urgent items.

Users may, at any time, submit a no confidence petition - either anonymously or in Server Talk, towards any member(s) or arm of the leadership team. This is treated similarly to a leadership application in that anonymous feedback will be collected for two days, and a decision made after that period. If at least 0.8% of the server users (the same percentage to reject a leadership application) sustain the petition, the petition is considered passed. 

This will enact a formal conflict resolution process and investigation against the indicted leader(s), including potential accountability measures.

In the case that the petition is against an entire arm of leadership (such as all Planners, or *the entire leadership team*) the indicted group is expected to participate in an open server discussion about the reasons behind the discontent and all leaders will at minimum be reduced to "interim" occupants of their positions and forced to reapply after the proceedings have concluded. Such a petition has a slightly higher pass threshold of 1% of discord users, due to the chaos such an action inevitably creates.
