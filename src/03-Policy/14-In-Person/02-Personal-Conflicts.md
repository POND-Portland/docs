In the case of very serious interpersonal conflicts, some users may be barred from attending some events with other users. The precise nature of such decisions is up to the Mediators handling the conflict - but here are some general guidelines:

Generally speaking, in such cases users will be barred from attending events *hosted* by the other user(s), and at the very least *heavily discouraged* from attending events with low attendance containing the other user(s).

However, very large events, such as the monthly gatherings, will generally allow both parties to attend, though they'll be under pretty strict instructions to limit their interaction. Only in very extreme cases will one party or the other be wholesale barred from such events simply due to the presence of the other, and any situations that warrant such a strict measure are probably severe enough to just warrant a ban in most cases.
