In-person events have a few special elements. For one - the event host is allowed to set their own rules. So long as the rules are in the spirit of the server, they should be considered as "binding" for purposes of accountability. Which is to say - if users are routinely breaking (reasonable) rules that event hosts set, this is essentially identical to repeatedly breaking server rules.

In addition, certain rules apply less, or can be outright suspended with mutual consent in in-person events. While not an exhaustive list: In particular, Rule 4 (no heated topics or debates on things such as politics etc.) is essentially always suspended in person, due to the different nature of face-to-face interaction. It's also almost always allowed to discuss topics such as alcohol and weed. Even so, *please* respect peoples' wishes if they don't want to participate in such topics or behavior. 

Rules such as the ones against bigotry and harassment *always* apply, and no, users *cannot* make a "bigotry allowed" event - the ability for users to define their own rules for their own events only goes as far as community values and safety are upheld.
