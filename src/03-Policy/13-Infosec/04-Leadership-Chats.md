The leadership chats (outside Mediation issues and other designated sensitive data) in general are not secret, but leaders are encouraged to use discretion when talking about backend stuff - in particular, don't speak for the leadership team unless the leadership team agrees in advance on what they want to say. You also should be careful about delivering too many gritty details on initiatives that may not even happen - just to manage expectations. Finally, please don't leak other leaders' words to a another user they may have an issue with - let them control how and when they want to express their frustration to that person themselves and on their own time (this really applies even outside a leadership context, but is more clearly enforceable here).

Leaders *are* permitted to vent about proposals, frustrations, and other leaders' behavior privately to other users - including those outside leadership. Venting can be healthy processing that prevents conflicts from festering, just don't let it rise to the level of outgrouping or bullying. Even so, the same guideline here applies as it does for internal user notes - don't publicly air dirty laundry to a wide group of people. It's bullying!

In addition, resist the urge to "talk shop" at length outside leadership channels and dedicated places like server talk, just because it's alienating to users who are not in leadership.
