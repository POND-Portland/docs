# Support Section

The support section is not *not* secret. Or rather, it's not secret but extreme caution should be used when sharing information outside of it. Due to the nature of many of the channels there, people share a lot of personal information. Leaders and users alike can be held accountable for spilling personal details without someone's consent outside designated spaces.

That said, it's absolutely not forbidden to casually reference a conversation from the support section elsewhere in the server or at events, provided everyone is being mindful about private personal details. Especially since many conversations in that section are about more general concepts and not just sordid stories of one's private personal life. Repeated harm caused to other community members caused by leaking intimate details will result in accountability actions. 

On the other hand: we would like to remind users that the support section is, at best, only *kind of* private. Maki level 4 is a very low bar, and inactive users retain access indefinitely. While you're encouraged to be as vulnerable as you want, when deciding what information to share, remember that pretty much any stranger capable of appearing nice for a few hours can get access to and use your posts as maliciously as they want, and we'd probably never even know.

CAVEAT: Sensitive data in support may be flagged and shared in leadership chat for moderation purposes, or as evidence when discussing things like the need for certain mental health policies - though leaders must use their training and discretion in determining the sensitivity level of any info reposted there.
