Due to mediation being moved off-server, Tickets are rarely classified as secret, but they also usually shouldn't be shared in a cavalier way without reason. Tickets involving established users are generally treated with much higher sensitivity than rando joins that just spam or make trouble. In some rare cases, particularly weird tickets from quickly banned new joins might be shared for the bit.

Some examples of things it might be okay to share about tickets:
- "Oh yeah, I was helping \<x\> with their event and I think it went really well! I wish more people opened tickets for event mentoring!"
- "lmao, man this spammer really went for it \<screenshot\>"
- "yeah, we've gotten a few tickets about that, and we \[try to/plan to\] handle it like..." (without revealing the people who made the tickets)
- "this user helped us a *lot* with developing this new great thing for the server" (happened to be organized in a ticket; example: thanking Choomba for designing the server logo)

Some examples of things it's not okay to share about tickets:
- A screenshot of another user's DMs (even if they're DMs showing a random spammer, it's *their* DMs)
- The exact names of users who have submitted certain complaints (to prevent people from going after them - if they want their name attached they can put it in server talk)
- Screenshots of *serious* tickets with established users
- Any *specific* details about a circumstance around a complaint that could identify a complainant, even unintentionally
- Any interpersonal issues or complaints about specific users, *especially* if they quickly get escalated to Mediation
- Discussions of specific rule infractions
  - Exception: if a user was making a scene in the middle of chat, it might be appropriate to give a very quick, low-detail "the user has been muted and pulled into a ticket to address this behavior"
