Leaders are expected to adhere to the Information Security policy fairly strictly. That said, that does not mean the policy *itself* is strict. That is to say, most things are pretty lax, but the rules around what must be kept secret and secure are *very* rigorously enforced.

Broadly speaking, leadership chat is *not* secret except as specified elsewhere in these Documents. However, leaders should take care and rely on their training when determining if it's okay to share something - and remember that leaking *sensitive* information will result in a strict accountability process. If you're even remotely unsure - either ask in leadership chat if it's okay, or don't share altogether. Newer leaders will be given much more grace in accidental minor violations of this policy than seasoned leaders.
