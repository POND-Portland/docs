It is TODO and will be fleshed out after the more urgent items.

Bots are used on the server for a variety of tasks. In general, such bots should be safe, but we have specific policies on their usage. In particular, when bots are collecting sensitive data, care should be taken to ensure the data is handled in a sensitive way. Any bot feature we're going to use for such purposes should be tested thoroughly before rolling it out to users - and a guide should be written so users can be reassured about what we can and cannot do or figure out with the data we get. 

In the event we realize a mistake in something we've used, we should acknowledge the mistake and quickly find a solution. There are no penalties for making such a mistake unless it was done maliciously, and a talking-to (or a "gentle suggestion" to maybe leave bot-related duties to other leaders) may be needed if it's done negligently more than once or twice.
