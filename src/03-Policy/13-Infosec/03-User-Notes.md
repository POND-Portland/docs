Backend channels may be used to keep dedicated moderation notes about various users. This can be disciplinary or infraction notes, but also documenting concerns for a user's well-being. The existence of this isn't secret (nor surprising to most users we'd think), and neither are its contents *per se*. However, leaders should never go around publicly listing who has notes on them, or for what reason they have them - whether in chat or at an event, and doing so will be met with a strict penalty for bullying.

The lack of secrecy extends insofar as you should remember that any user could become a leader at any time and see what we've documented, so nothing should be said that you wouldn't say to their face. In addition, many such posts are started because of a series of complaints about users (well below the level of a formal mediation process) - often by a mix of leaders and regular users in tickets and DMs. It's hard to separate "leaking" such user note information and simply engaging in healthy venting with a friend about a user you find frustrating due to their public behavior.

That said, it is, *at best*, considered *very* bad form to just open someone's thread and go over all their documented incidents for gossip purposes, even with someone on the same page with the same information, and will result in a formal accountability process due to sheer bullying and violating the community spirit alone.

To prevent this policy from getting complicated - sensitive mediation notes should *never* be stored here (or anywhere in leadership chat, for that matter), other than brief summaries that a conversation was had and action was taken, such sensitive notes should be stored somewhere off-server only accessible to Mediators.
