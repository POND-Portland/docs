Complaints about the server or its practices received in DM by any leader should be logged in an appropriate leadership channel. The name of the complainant need not be revealed, but we want to maintain a list of at least the *genre* of various complaints, and how many people have complained about it, to prevent a loose sense of "many people are saying this" but no concrete idea of *who* or *how many* or *how recently*.
