Generally a ban is for serious infractions or disregard for the rules, as well as spammers. Kicks are for things like non-local people (as they could move here later), or members who are under 21 (since they might grow up someday, who knows, Kids Next Door rule).

If an established community member is banned, a ban log detailing their username and infraction must be posted in #bot-spam within 24 hours so users cannot be silently disappeared with no warning. The infraction description can be somewhat vague if more specific info would out victims or reveal other sensitive information.
