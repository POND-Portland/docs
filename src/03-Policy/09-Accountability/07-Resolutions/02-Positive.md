A "positive" resolution for mediation between multiple users is one where all parties have agreed the problem is satisfactorily resolved. This doesn't necessarily mean there are no "hard feelings", but both parties are satisfied with the measures taken, and the measures taken do not severely change or restrict the user's participation or roles in the server.

A "positive resolution" for a rule infraction is one where the accountability measure taken does not result in severe consequences (such as being barred from support, or stripped of a leadership position), in particular when this happens because the user makes a sincere, concerted attempt to fix their mistake and take accountability for their actions of their own accord.

These definitions are mostly useful for reference purposes, and are not official designations.
