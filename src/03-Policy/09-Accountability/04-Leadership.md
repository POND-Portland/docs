Leaders are subject to some extra accountability requirements. In particular - for some more severe violations, leaders will have their roles temporarily removed until a resolution is reached (such resolution may make this removal permanent). Their seat is not considered empty during such a process, instead they are treated similarly to being ["On Break"](./Role%20Structure.md#on-break) until it resolves.
