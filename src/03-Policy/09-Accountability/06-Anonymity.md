Mediation processes in group DMs must keep the users anonymous, except by mutual consent. Other leaders should refrain from "figuring out" who the involved parties are from context cues, and if they do, should not tell others about their suspicions. 

The precise nature of conflicts is treated as sensitive information, though leaders not actively involved in the Mediation process are permitted to talk with friends about such situations *provided* they are discussing info they only know from channels outside their leadership duties, or info the involved parties are clearly and unambiguously sharing as "open information". Leaders should be *extremely* careful doing this as there is a very fine line involved, and an accountability process *will* be initiated at the mere implication of a failure to abide by the rules. The severity of the consequences is determined by the sensitivity and volume of the leaked information. When in doubt, don't!

Leaders who are actively involved as a *user* in any mediation proceeding are permitted to share information openly *with friends* without consequence - except the social consequences of their own actions if they break a friend's trust. However, they should refrain from discussing such a thing in leadership channels outside the formal mediation process.
