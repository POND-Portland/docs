If no Mediator can take point, or a second mediator for a given process cannot be found -

Temporary Mediators will be selected by a vote of all Tier 2 leadership with no CoI. The selected Mediator must not be barred from Mediation due to an accountability measure. The preference for bodies to choose from goes as follows: Moderators, Developers, COs, CRs, Planners. No leader is required to be an interim Mediator, and may opt-out of candidacy by request. More experienced leaders in those pools should be preferred over less experienced ones. Said selected member may immediately begin mediating, but also must undergo an accelerated version of Mediator training in the process.

In the event **no** leaders are eligible, a call to users will be put out (without details about the conflict), and selected from volunteers. Failing that, we panic.
