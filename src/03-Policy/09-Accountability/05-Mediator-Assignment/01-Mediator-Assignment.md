# Assignment of Mediators

Mediators will be assigned based on whoever has the current lowest caseload. Users may request a specific Mediator to take point if they so choose, and this request must be granted barring a disqualifying factor such as a CoI. To accommodate such requests, management of other cases may be given to other eligible mediators to even out the workload.

While one Mediator will be the "point person" in every case, all cases should have at least 2 mediators - temporary Mediators may be selected as per [the contingencies](./02-Contingencies.md) if all other Mediators have a CoI.
