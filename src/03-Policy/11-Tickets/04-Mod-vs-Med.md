Moderators may handle disciplinary tickets that are things like random spammers, or new users that come in and immediately do very little but make trouble. However, for any more advanced situation, Mods should ping the Mediators to transfer point.

If the situation is urgent and disruptive, and no Mediators are around, Mods (and - if it's really late at night and nobody is around - other leaders) may apply Ticket Mute to a person, and open a ticket to tell them a Mediator will get to them when one is available, but otherwise abstain from handling it further (aside from deleting messages if necessary).
