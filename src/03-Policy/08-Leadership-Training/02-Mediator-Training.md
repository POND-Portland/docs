Mediators must undergo additional training in conflict management and Restorative/Transformative Justice -- **TBD**, they are expected to constantly improve their skills in this area.

New Mediators must finish some undecided portion of this training before officially handling any Mediation processes, except in the short window before such training is formally decided on and implemented - and in emergencies where no viable Mediator candidates are available.
