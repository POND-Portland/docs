# Recusal

For our purposes, recusal can be declared at six levels:
1. A bias is declared for posterity, but is not considered severe enough to warrant disengaging from the topic 
2. A commitment to not vote on a certain topic
3. A commitment to not be the primary point person on a project, proposal, or accountability proceeding
4. A commitment to abstain from engaging with or commenting on a project, proposal, or accountability proceeding altogether
5. A request to not be involved in any way with the topic at hand, including being privy to as few details as possible
6. The leader is directly involved in a situation under mediation, and will be engaging as if they were a regular user

Leaders may recuse themselves at any level (except 1) without specifying the reason, in case it involves sensitive information they'd rather not be public knowledge. Leaders are *heavily encouraged* to withhold the recusal reason in cases where it involves sensitive private matters or traumatic incidents. 

In cases where the gravity of the reason is *so* heavy it might bias the other leaders' judgement just by hearing it, openly revealing such info in the process of declaring a recusal will itself be considered a violation of the CoI policy, and a failure to properly recuse oneself. If one wants to air such information, they must do so in the course of a formal mediation process at their own pace and comfort level. Such violations will generally receive much lighter consequences than other failures of recusal, unless they happen repeatedly.
