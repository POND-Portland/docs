# Conflict of Interest Policy

A Conflict of Interest (CoI) is defined as a relationship or interest that may cause a leader to either feel forced to not vote their conscience, or suffer undue bias due to their personal circumstances or relationships.

Due to the nature of our community, the vast majority of our conflicts of interest are going to be close relationships with other users. Whether a CoI is relevant or not depends on the severity of the CoI, and the context of the measure being voted on. Leaders are expected to be aware of their conflicts of interest, and actively declare them and be willing to recuse themselves as necessary
