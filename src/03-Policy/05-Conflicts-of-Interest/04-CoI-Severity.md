# CoI Severity Levels

While we cannot specify every possible type of CoI, and the severity may not be strictly correct for all cases of the below items, this serves as a rough guideline for identifying the severity of various common CoIs:

__Low:__
- Casual friendship
- One party owes the other some small amount of money
- Strong dislike or personality conflict

__Medium:__
- Close/Best friendship
- Cohabitation
- Romantic partnership
- Close working relationship outside POND (coworkers, volunteer organizations, etc.)

__High:__
- Complicated personal history (e.g. a bad breakup)
- Landlord/renter relationship
- Boss/employee relationship

__Severe:__
- Traumatic history (e.g. abuse, harassment, etc.)
- Marriage
- Financially or physically dependent/caretaker relationship

There are no strict rules for which situation warrants recusal when a CoI is present, but generally speaking Mediators should be wary about participating in anything but the lowest stakes Mediation process without at least some form of recusal beyond __Low__ severity, and it may become very problematic if a single branch of POND Leadership consists mainly of people with __High__ or __Severe__ CoIs. Having multiple __Medium__ CoIs at once should be treated as __High__ or above.
