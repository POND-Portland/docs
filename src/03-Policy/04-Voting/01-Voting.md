# Voting

Votes are done primarily by Tier 2 leaders within their own bodies, though some votes may specify different methods of approval, or different groups of leadership (such as all Tier 2 leaders, or all leaders in general).

In general, proposed resolutions that need to be voted on have a hard deadline of moving from drafting -> voting by the next leadership meeting. This mandatory vote is permitted to be a simple vote to table the resolution, or extend the deadline. Proposals whose votes are routinely delayed should be audited to see if perhaps there's an alternate path or something more urgent to prioritize.

Tier 2 leaders can declare voting deadlines at-will for their own proposals and initiatives, so long as the proposal has been posted or in discussion for at least a day, and the voting window is at least 24-hours long (since all Tier 2 leaders must review and vote within that timeframe). As soon as a vote passes the acceptance threshold, it may be implemented without waiting for straggling voters. After a vote has passed, people may not change their votes (but stragglers should still record their votes for the record, and to prevent an implication of nonfeasance).

The [Role Structure Document](../../02-Role-Structure/01-Role-Structure.md) contains more in-depth info on voting requirements, abstention, and who is allowed to vote. The [Conflict of Interest Policy](../05-Conflicts-of-Interest/01-Conflicts-of-Interest.md) also contains a few provisions for vote eligibility.
