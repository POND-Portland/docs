# Automatic Abstention Votes

"Automatic Abstention Votes" are a specific type of vote involving Tier 1 leaders. An Automatic Abstention is a vote that dictates that within a specified timeframe (typically 24 to 48-hours), anyone who hasn't voted is automatically considered to have abstained. This is used because Tier 1 leaders have no deadline to check in or vote regularly.

There is no quorum for voting, to prevent pocket vetoing by a small dissenting group that otherwise could not reach a majority refusing to vote.

Technically speaking, *all* votes are Automatic Abstention Votes, it's just that Tier 2 leaders that "abstain" this way more than a few times are liable to lose their roles due to nonfeasance. Tier 2 leaders should instead explicitly declare their abstention.
