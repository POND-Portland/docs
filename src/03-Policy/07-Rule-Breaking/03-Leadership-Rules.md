Leadership rules should all have their severity pretty clearly defined in the sections outlining them. Leaders are expected to adhere by the leadership standards very strictly, and formal accountability processes are much more likely to be triggered for leadership rule violations (outside the more severe regular rules), that said, as outlined in the [Accountability Process](../09-Accountability/01-Accountability.md) section, our server does value reform and repair over performative punishment. Still, severe and repeated violations will be treated much more harshly than regular users would be.
