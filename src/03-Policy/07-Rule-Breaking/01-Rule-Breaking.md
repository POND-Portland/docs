Users who break rules will be held accountable for doing so. The exact infraction will depend heavily on the severity of the infraction, the gravity of the rule, and previous conduct - and can range from a simple talking to to an outright ban. For low-severity rules (such as content warning guidelines, or lightly getting into politics), the occasional failure to abide by them will not be punished so long as the user corrects the mistake/knocks it off when requested.

Random spammers and new joins that immediately come in swinging and breaking rules may be treated much more harshly than established users.
